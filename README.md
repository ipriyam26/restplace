# Natural Selection Simulation

This project is a simulation of an ecosystem undergoing natural selection, demonstrating the principles of evolution in action.

**Overview**

The simulation creates an environment populated with simple virtual organisms. Each organism has a genome that determines its behavior via a simple neural network. The organisms interact with their environment and with each other according to these behaviors.

The simulation runs for a number of generations. In each generation, organisms act based on their neural network outputs, and the state of the environment is updated accordingly. At the end of each generation, a selection process is performed, where organisms are chosen to reproduce based on their fitness.

The offspring inherit their parent's genome, with a small chance of mutation. Over time, through the process of mutation and selection, the population of organisms can evolve increasingly complex and effective behaviors.

**Features**

- **Genome-based behaviors**: Each organism's behaviors are determined by its genome, which is encoded as a binary string and interpreted as a simple neural network.
- **Flexible selection strategies**: The selection process can be customized with different strategies, allowing for exploration of different evolutionary pressures.
- **Visualization**: The state of the environment is visualized at each step, allowing you to see the organisms and their behaviors in real time.
- **Modular design**: The simulation is organized into several modules, including Organism, Genome, Environment, Selection, and Simulation, for easy customization and extension.

**Future Work**

While the current simulation provides a basic demonstration of natural selection, there are many possible extensions and improvements that could make it a more accurate and interesting model of evolution. Future work could include adding more complex behaviors, introducing different types of organisms (e.g., predators and prey), or modeling more realistic environmental factors (e.g., resource availability, geographical features).
